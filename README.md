# Problem Scope

## Overview

Modern organizations rely heavily on multiple communication platforms—Jira, Slack, GitHub, and email—to facilitate collaboration. However, this distributed approach to communication creates significant challenges in:

- **Data Fragmentation**: Important information is scattered across platforms, leading to inefficiencies in tracking updates, decisions, and project progress.
- **Lack of Observability**: Managers and employees lack visibility into ongoing conversations and workflows, causing missed deadlines, duplicated efforts, and unclear priorities.
- **Ineffective Reporting**: Companies struggle to generate meaningful summaries and insights from raw communication data, leading to poor decision-making.
- **Overload and Noise**: Employees face communication overload, making it difficult to focus on relevant updates while filtering out noise.
- **Disconnected Teams**: Teams become siloed, and the lack of visibility into broader company communications impairs collaboration and alignment.

## Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, we are developing a **Communication Observability Platform** that:

1. Scrapes data from Jira, Slack, GitHub, and email.
2. Leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to summarize and analyze data.
3. Provides daily, weekly, and monthly reports customized for each employee’s role and responsibilities.
4. Creates graph and network visualizations to illustrate communication patterns and identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and gaps.
5. Enhances team alignment and operational transparency through actionable insights.
